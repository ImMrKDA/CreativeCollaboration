# WEB14202: Creative Collaboration

## Kevin DÃ­az

**Student No:** 96454416

**Course:** BA (Hons) Web Media, Level 2.

**Unit Code:** WEB14102

### Introduction

In this term I've worked in two different projects. The first project was about rebranding a charity. We had to look at their social media, website and images. The second project was about creating an online image library.

### Important note

I was supposed to do both projects with the same group. I started with team 5 and I did the first project with them but I ended up with team 2 doing the second project due to the fact that the other web media student from team 2 left and I had to replace him. The reason I'm saying this is because, my formative presentation link will be with team 5 and my summative presentation link will be with team 2.
